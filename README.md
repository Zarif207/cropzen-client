## 📘 How It Works

1. Farmers create an account and list crops with name, category, location, price, and available quantity.  
2. Buyers browse all listed crops and send an *interest request* with a message and quantity.  
3. Farmers review all received interests in each crop’s detail page and can accept or reject them.  
4. Once accepted, the crop’s available quantity automatically decreases.  
5. Both parties can track interactions in “My Posts” and “My Interests” sections.
